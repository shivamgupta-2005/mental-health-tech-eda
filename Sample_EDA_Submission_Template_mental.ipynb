        "In today’s fast-paced tech-driven world, mental health is one of the most pressing but often neglected aspects of employee well-being. The stigma associated with discussing mental health in professional environments often leads to silence, reduced productivity, burnout, and in extreme cases, resignation or breakdown. To understand this problem better, we explored a real-world dataset from Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) which contains responses from over 1,200 individuals working in the tech industry. The dataset primarily focuses on how mental health is perceived, treated, and handled in the workplace, along with related factors like remote work, company size, benefits, and personal history.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover meaningful patterns and actionable insights from the survey. We started with data cleaning, where we removed unrealistic age values (e.g., under 18 or over 65), normalized inconsistent gender entries, and filled missing values in key columns like self_employed and work_interfere. After cleaning, we were left with a dataset of 1,250 reliable entries ready for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The EDA was conducted through a series of targeted visualizations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Gender vs Treatment – Females and other gender groups were more likely to seek treatment than males, indicating a gender-based gap in openness or awareness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Family History vs Treatment – Those with a family history of mental illness were significantly more likely to seek help themselves, suggesting a strong influence of personal exposure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remote Work vs Work Interference – People working remotely reported fewer work interferences due to mental health, indicating remote work could help ease stress for many.\n",
        "\n",
        "Company Size vs Benefits – Larger companies were more likely to offer mental health benefits. However, in smaller firms, a large number of respondents either lacked benefits or were unaware of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Work Interfere vs Treatment – As the level of interference increased (from “rarely” to “often”), the probability of seeking treatment also increased.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mental Health Consequence vs Supervisor Discussion – Employees who feared negative consequences were much less likely to talk about their issues with supervisors, showing a clear need for safer, judgment-free environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this analysis, we derived several key business implications. Organizations need to not only provide mental health benefits but also actively educate employees about them. Remote work flexibility can be a powerful tool in reducing mental fatigue. Most importantly, stigma reduction and safe discussion environments are essential for increasing openness.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates how simple survey data, when explored correctly, can uncover deep-rooted patterns affecting employee well-being. It helps HR and leadership teams make more inclusive and effective decisions. The insights gathered are not just numbers — they represent real human experiences that, when addressed properly, can improve both individual lives and organizational performance.\n",
